Notes to support the table

Sea lice are adult females, presented as monthly averages (per fish).

Farms count sea lice every week. Figures are reported by calendar month. Therefore
some months include five full weeks and some include four full weeks to cover the 52
weeks of the year.



"Fallow" = the farm was fallow or empty throughout the entire reporting month.

“Farm stocked in May” = the farm was fallow or empty at the start of the month but was
restocked during the month.

"Farm fallowed in May" = the farm was stocked at the start of the month but became
fallow or empty during that month.

“No count – harvesting” = fish were being harvested throughout the month. Under such
circumstances it is not always possible to record the lice count.

"Broodstock fish - visual checks" - the fish on the farm are broodstock and they were
checked visually without removing them from the water.

"No count - farm recently stocked" - the farm was recently stocked and it may not have
been possible or appropriate to record a lice count.
